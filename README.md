Serendipidance is a web app that provides a platform for dance students to schedule classes to take and dance studios to schedule classes to offer. The goal of the app is to consolidate and display all of the dance classes that are currently being offered by participating studios so that students can always find the information they need in one place. Student and studio users will have personalized views of their schedules where studios can effeectively offer or cancel classes, and students can easily add or remove classes from their customized training schedules.

<h4>Students</h4>

Student users have a personalized schedule view where they can add classes from the hub that interests them. The schedule keeps track of the total cost of their classes as well as any classes that they've previously taken.

Studio users can offer more classes to the hub by completing the form in their schedule view. They have the option of adding one-time or weekly classes, and can cancel classes by removing them from their schedule. The studio schedule also keeps track of current and past offered classes.
